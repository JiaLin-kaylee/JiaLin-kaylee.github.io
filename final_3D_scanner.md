**FINAL PROCESSES**

So, it's been a while since I've done an update, BUT, I've done a lot of work. So lets start off with my coding processes.
I've been finalizing my plotter, which is supposed to plot the distance in relativity to voltage. This took a LONG time, at first my plotter looked a little strange, it gave very scattered data.

It looked a little scary, just like the image above. I'm happy to tell you guys, it doesn't look like that now, it looks much better. because I learned that we had to define terms or else the plotter would most likely not interpret the data correctly. I also learned that we need to make VS code read the data slower, or else the plotter would go haywire.

this is my python code, I adjusted it a bit by defining what the distance and voltage. It improved the quality and result of my graph, making it flow smoothly.


**MATERIALS**

My materials are VS code and Arduino IDE. Also, the extension cable, and MAYBE also the arduino, and the stepper motors.

I was able to get everything to move and read. But, I faced a lot of challenges, I didn't know how to code and I sadly had to search up how to code and ask WebbGPT to do some editing for me. It was complicated, but in the end it worked. I want all readers to take this away: even though you may be suffering in the beginning, in the end the suffering will produce a result so good that you would forget you ever suffered.

I hope you like the cat that my corrected and working code made!

**PERSONAL+EMOTIONAL JOURNEY**

How did you feel?

I felt very good, much more confident than I was at the beginning of the year. I feel like I actually learned something from this class, my goal this year was to learn how to code, now I know how to code! As 2026 starts, I would have completed my goal and I'm positive that I will continue to complete my other goals for next year.

How did these feelings change as you encountered challenges and made progress?

I made progress, the challenges dissappeared, I feel happy, and I would like to continue to feel this way. Next semester I want to learn how to CAD, so I can catch up to my partner Kano! She's becoming a great CADer and she motivates be to continue to pursue my goals.

How do these feelings relate to your journey of discovery?

My journey of discovery was long and hard, at the beginning of the project, I had some very BAD feelings about the project, I thought I was incompetent to make good progress, but I found out that was not true. Now, I'm more confident in my abilities and am so grateful for all the help I was offered this semester.


**MOTIVATING QUESTIONS**

when you are feeling hopeless, it's good to ask yourself questions, for example when I was struggling to find out what was wrong with my code I asked myself:

**Have you looked through the entire code and looked for errors?**

**Have you asked your teachers for help?**

**Do you feel confident in your abilities to improve?**

If I said no to all of these, I would go and ask for help, look for errors, and find areas I should improve on emotionally.

**SPECIAL SHOUT OUT**

To my partner Kano:
If you ever read this, I just want to thank you so much for cadding everything. Without you I would have failed in even getting everything mehanically attached. Thank you for being my other half on this long and tracherous journey.
