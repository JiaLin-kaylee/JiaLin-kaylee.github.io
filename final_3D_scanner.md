**FINAL PROCESSES**

So, it's been a while since I've done an update, BUT, I've done a lot of work. So lets start off with my coding processes.
I've been finalizing my plotter, which is supposed to plot the distance in relativity to voltage. This took a LONG time, at first my plotter looked a little strange, it gave very scattered data.

It looked a little scary, just like the image above. I'm happy to tell you guys, it doesn't look like that now, it looks much better.

this is my python code, I adjusted it a bit by defining what the distance and voltage. It improved the quality and result of my graph, making it flow smoothly.


**MATERIALS**

My materials are VS code and Arduino IDE. Also, the extension cable, and MAYBE also the arduino, and the stepper motors.
