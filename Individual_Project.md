**Day 2**

10 Ideas

- create a widget app that lists out her to-do's
- I can try and remind her daily
- create chatbot with monthly planner
- I'll buy her free crumbl for every month of finished to-do list
- teach her how to use canvas
- gift her a strict Asian mom
- remind her to do work at school by making her do work while i do work
- if she doesn't do her work, then she cannot attend sports activities
- Do work in the morning in compensation for sleeping earlier (and during free blocks)
- make a machine that makes annoying noises whenver she forgets to stay on task
- built-in clock on her phone that sends her notifications until she does her work.

**Day 3**

Condensing



**WIDGET APP**


**quick access to tasks:** A widget lets you see what you need to do without opening an app.

**reducing mental load:** Offloading tasks into a visible space helps people feel less overwhelmed.

**building better habits:** A simple, always‑visible list nudges users to stay consistent.

**learning app development:** It’s a manageable starter project that teaches UI, state management, and user experience.

**personalizing productivity:** Many people want a tool that fits their workflow instead of generic apps.



**MAKE A CHATBOT**

**automating reminders:** People forget things; bots don’t.

**supporting wellbeing:** Timely nudges can help with routines, self‑care, or school tasks.

**creating a sense of connection:** A chatbot can feel like a friendly companion rather than a cold alarm.

**experimenting with AI behavior:** It’s a great way to learn about triggers, logic, and conversational design.

**building scalable support tools:** A bot can help many users at once without extra effort.
