**Day 1**

**WHO??**


**Vivian: I have trouble keeping track of assignments and managing my time, so a tech tool that combines reminders and planning would really help.**


-Basketball
-Sports
-Volleyball takes time out of her day
-She has trouble doing things at school because of constant distractions
-She isn’t used to canvas 
-Hard to not be tired and do homework


What I’ve Noticed About Vivian
•	She struggles to keep track of assignments: I can tell she genuinely wants to stay on top of her work, but without a clear system, things slip through the cracks. It’s not because she doesn’t care — it’s because she doesn’t have a tool that works the way she works.
•	Time management is a real challenge for her: Between basketball, volleyball, and everything else happening in her day, she barely gets a moment to breathe, let alone plan out homework.
•	Sports take up huge chunks of her schedule: Practices, games, and travel time eat into her evenings, leaving her exhausted and with limited time to focus.
•	School is full of distractors for her: She gets pulled into conversations, noise, and movement around her, which makes it hard for her to start tasks during class.
•	Canvas isn’t intuitive for her yet: She’s not used to the platform, so she misses assignments or doesn’t know where to look.
•	She often ends up with no time or energy for homework: By the time she’s free, she’s drained — mentally and physically.
What I Want to Do for Her
•	I want to be her reminder person: Not in a nagging way, but in a supportive, “I’ve got your back” way. I want her to feel like someone is helping her stay organized.
•	I want to build something that actually fits her life: Not a generic planner, not a complicated app — something simple, friendly, and made specifically for the way she moves through her day.
•	I want her to feel less stressed and more in control: She deserves tools that make her life easier, not heavier.
What I Think the App Should Include
•	Smart reminders that adapt to her schedule: If she has practice, the app should automatically suggest earlier start times or break tasks into smaller chunks.
•	A home screen widget she can’t ignore: Something visual and simple — assignments, due dates, and a “what to do next” box.
•	Quick-add tasks: So she can jot something down between classes without opening a full app.
•	A clean, distraction-free interface: No clutter, no overwhelm — just clarity.
•	Canvas-friendly input: Even if it’s manual, it should be easy for her to copy/paste assignments in.
•	A daily plan that adjusts automatically: If she’s busy, the app should lighten the load; if she’s free, it can suggest catching up.
 Why This Matters to Me
•	I want her to feel supported: She’s juggling so much, and I don’t want her to feel alone in it.
•	I want the tool to feel like a friend, not a chore: Something that nudges her gently, not something that overwhelms her.
•	I want her to succeed without burning out: She’s capable — she just needs a system that matches her reality.

**Day 2**

10 Ideas

- create a widget app that lists out her to-do's

- I can try and remind her daily

- create chatbot with monthly planner

- I'll buy her free crumbl for every month of finished to-do list

- teach her how to use canvas

- gift her a strict Asian mom
  
- remind her to do work at school by making her do work while i do work

- if she doesn't do her work, then she cannot attend sports activities

- Do work in the morning in compensation for sleeping earlier (and during free blocks)

- make a machine that makes annoying noises whenver she forgets to stay on task

- built-in clock on her phone that sends her notifications until she does her work.

**Day 3**

CONDENSING


**MOTIVATING QUESTION**

"How can I make AN effective and accessible THING to help with schedule."


**WIDGET APP**


**quick access to tasks:** A widget lets you see what you need to do without opening an app.

**reducing mental load:** Offloading tasks into a visible space helps people feel less overwhelmed.

**building better habits:** A simple, always‑visible list nudges users to stay consistent.

**learning app development:** It’s a manageable starter project that teaches UI, state management, and user experience.

**personalizing productivity:** Many people want a tool that fits their workflow instead of generic apps.



**MAKE A CHATBOT**

**automating reminders:** People forget things; bots don’t.

**supporting wellbeing:** Timely nudges can help with routines, self‑care, or school tasks.

**creating a sense of connection:** A chatbot can feel like a friendly companion rather than a cold alarm.

**experimenting with AI behavior:** It’s a great way to learn about triggers, logic, and conversational design.

**building scalable support tools:** A bot can help many users at once without extra effort.

Here is the finished agent, I have tested this a couple of times and it also sends a buch of reminders to your email.

**Day 4 and Beyond**


**CHALLENGE**

Balancing user needs with technical limitations: Vivian might want features that are hard to build or require tools you haven’t learned yet.
Designing reminders that help without overwhelming: Too many notifications can annoy users; too few won’t change behavior.
Keeping the chatbot accurate and responsive: Logic errors, timing issues, or unclear prompts can make the bot behave unpredictably.
Motivating consistent use over time: The tool works only if Vivian actually uses it, which means the design must feel rewarding, not like extra work.
Testing with different users and adjusting: Feedback from your mom, yourself, and Vivian may conflict, so you have to decide what to prioritize.
Managing distractions and workflow during development: Building a tool meant to reduce distraction can ironically be distracting for you as the creator.

**FUTURE PLANS**

Mr. Raus sent me a link for a USC project and I've been looking into it a lot. I really want to do more hardware so the future plan is to relearn how to crochet and make a Blossom bot!.

**Tester 1: Myself**

I asked the chatbot multiple questions and it seemed to respond to me pretty well, here are some pictures.

**Tester 2: My mother**

She thought it was funny that I made this. But it also seemed to be responding quite well.


**Final Tester: Vivian**

She enjoyed the robot quite a lot!

**REFLECTION**

This project showed me how a simple idea—helping Vivian stay organized—could grow into a full, functional tool that actually supports someone’s daily life. Building the chatbot pushed me to think about real user needs, not just features, and testing it with different people helped me refine how it communicates. Watching Vivian enjoy it made the whole process feel meaningful, because it proved that thoughtful design can genuinely make someone’s routine easier. Overall, this experience strengthened my confidence in creating tech that blends practicality, empathy, and a little bit of fun.

Absolutely — here’s a clean, punchy bullet‑point version with clear strengths, growth areas, and what you learned about the process and your stakeholders.

### What I Learned About Myself as an Innovator
- **I’m good at identifying real user needs** and turning them into
 features that actually matter.  
- **I think naturally in systems** — connecting reminders, planning, motivation, and user behavior.  
- **I need to slow down during development** instead of rushing to build everything at once.  
- **I’m still growing in balancing ambition with technical limits** and testing more intentionally.

### What I Learned About My Stakeholders
- **People want tools that feel simple, personal, and non‑overwhelming** rather than complicated productivity systems.  
- **Small design choices change whether someone actually uses a tool** — tone, timing, layout, and ease of access matter.  
- **Users respond better when the tool feels friendly** instead of robotic or strict.

### What I Learned About the Design Process
- **Design is extremely iterative** — every test leads to a new adjustment.  
- **Feedback from different testers can conflict**, so you have to prioritize what aligns with the core problem.  
- **Prototyping quickly helps reveal issues early** instead of waiting for a “perfect” version.

### What I Learned About the Technical Side
- **Building a chatbot requires clear logic and clean prompts** or it behaves unpredictably.  
- **Automated reminders need careful tuning** so they help without overwhelming the user.  
- **Testing across multiple users exposes edge cases** you wouldn’t catch on your own.

If you want, I can help you turn this into a shorter version, a rubric‑aligned version, or a more polished final submission.
