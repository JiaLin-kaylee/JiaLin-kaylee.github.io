# Kaylee-Zhu
Hello, my name is Kaylee Zhu and Iâ€™m currently a high schooler focused on developing technology to impact the world.
Outside of school, I like to play piano, draw, or read new books. As an innovator, I like getting inspiration from the world around me and also my imagination.
This summer, I was able to work with a lego surgical tool. I learned that to become successful, you need to control and understand the robot, you can't solely rely on the robot doing everything for you.
My goals this year are: to learn code, become a better innovator, and to use my creativity.
