**Journal Entry 2**

Hey guys, welcome back to the 3D printer journal edition 2.
This time I'm gonna tell you about my mini group project. So, I was placed into a coding group and we are currently figuring out how to make the sensor sense distance and the object while turning on the servo.

Clear methodology:

My motivating questions:

**How can we make the distance sensor while the servos spin?**

surprisingly we got them spinning!!

**When will we have a working code???**

I was definitley not sure, but we had a working code almost every day we walked into class.



Well, to answer those questions I have luckily prepared a full list of the steps me and my partner have made:
Starting with some of out materials: stepper motors, servos, an arduino board, and a sensor.

In the beginning, we only had a code that sensed distance and voltage:

So in this code, we just made the distance detector sense voltage and the distance (I think if you need it, you should take our code!)
But, this didn't come too easily, since neither me or Kano knew how to code, we asked Mr. Raus (the coding master and the holy savior of my grade). Mr. Raus provided us some insights on what we should do, I even learned some code language:
'void loop' means that the code will go in an infinite loop. 'Serial.print' means that the code will spit out numbers depending on the distance and voltage it is detecting.


Not so in the beginning anymore, me and Kano ran into another problem. I was aboslutley terrified to start something new. AGAIN. This time we had to work on making stepper motors turn! It was a crazy experience, I didn't even know what I was doing, so I relied on master Kano to seek savior Mr. Raus again. And thank God we got a running code that made the stepper motors turn! My mind was screaming "YES" when Kano texted me late at night that the code was running. Here is what I have:

And then, even later into this journey I GOT EVEN MORE SCARED. We needed to combined the two codes so that the stepper motors can spin WHILE the sensor is detecting the distance and voltage...How was I supposed to do this? Ah yes, refer to my handy WebbGPT, but this time WebbGPT was not so handy because it made a ton of mistakes while generating the code, requiring me to go back and fix its errors. It was complicated and it required the assistance of Mr. Raus yet again. Well, with his help we were able to get the code up and running. Also shout out to Charley who helped us get more accurate data. I am so grateful that there are so many qualified people in this class that I can talk to any time. Oh I almost forgot, here is the new code!

The personal, emotional journey:

**How did you feel?**


I felt a little unstable/uncomfortable in the area of code, so I struggled a bit when I was trying to understand what I was writing.

**How did these feelings change as you encountered challenges and made progress?**


These feelings luckily started to change when I realized I had classmates and teachers I could rely on. The challenges really pushed me to learn more about my capabilites and extending them.


**How do these feelings relate to your journey of discovery?**


My journey of discovery is really rough...I guess when I decide to step into something new, it usually starts off hard and with me being an airhead, but I realized the deeper I delve, the more chances I have to learn something really cool. In this case, I am starting to get better at coding. I hope I continue getting better because it's my goal to learn how to code a little bit.
