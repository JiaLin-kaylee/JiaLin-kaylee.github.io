**Journal Entry 2**

Hey guys, welcome back to the 3D printer journal edition 2.
This time I'm gonna tell you about my mini group project. So, I was placed into a coding group and we are currently figuring out how to make the sensor sense distance and the object while turning on the servo.

Clear methodology:

Your motivating questions:

**How can we make the distance sensor while the servos spin?**


**What are some ideas/sketches?**


**When will we have a working code???**


Your materials
Your step by step process
How it unfolded, including problems
What you learned 
The personal, emotional journey:

How did you feel?
How did these feelings change as you encountered challenges and made progress?
How do these feelings relate to your journey of discovery?
