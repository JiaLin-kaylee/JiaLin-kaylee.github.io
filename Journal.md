**So, this is mt first email to Professor Mataric, who is in charge of the Blossom project!**



**Now here is my process of CADing the first model!**

**Journey & Reflection**


**Journey**
Beginning this project, I knew I wanted to understand Blossom not just as a concept, but as a physical system — something I could build, test, and iterate on myself. After sending my first email to Professor Mataric, I felt both excited and motivated to create a model that would help me understand the mechanics behind Blossom’s expressive movement.
I started by opening Fusion 360 and sketching the first structural components. My goal was to design a simple, modular base that could support the internal servo system while still leaving room for future adjustments. The early sketches were rough, but they helped me visualize proportions and movement paths.
From there, I began refining the geometry:
adjusting wall thicknesses so the parts would be strong enough to print,
shaping the internal cavity to house the servo,
and experimenting with different hinge placements to maximize the range of motion.
Each iteration taught me something new — whether it was how to better constrain a sketch, how to avoid over‑extruding a surface, or how to design with 3D‑printing tolerances in mind. By the time I reached the later models, the structure felt more intentional, more stable, and much closer to something that could actually function as a Blossom prototype.
This CAD process wasn’t just about building a part; it was about learning how expressive robotics begins at the design level. Every curve, joint, and dimension affects how the robot “feels” when it moves.


**Reflection**
Looking back, this stage of the project pushed me to think like both an engineer and a designer. I had to balance technical constraints with the emotional purpose of Blossom — creating a robot that feels soft, supportive, and alive.
I learned how important iteration is: the first model is never the final one, and each version reveals new questions. I also realized how much I enjoy the hands‑on problem‑solving that comes with CAD modeling. It’s a space where creativity and precision meet, and where small adjustments can completely change the outcome.


What I'm Going to Continue to do:

I will continue mapping out and making prototye=pes, relearn how to crochet, and then finish my first version of the ADHD robot!.
