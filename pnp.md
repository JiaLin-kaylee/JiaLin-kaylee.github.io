PNP PROJECT OVERVIEW:
In project PNP, I worked with the lasercutter team and created some designs for name plates (requested by our admissions team at Webb)
I got to work with Adobe Illustrator to create and use designs of the Webb Logo.

I also leared how to use a laser cutter to cut out this design. Here is some of the images I took while learning how to lasercut

This is an actual prototype my team and I made with the lasercutter. The material we used was acrylic. We almost got gassed because of the terrible ventilation system in the robotics room. Luckily, we are still alive and we have made some clean-cut prototypes.

A SPECIAL SHOUT OUT TO THE 3D PRINTING TEAM! They made some awesome prototypes and iterated so many cool ideas for the teams to try out. In conclusion, we decided that 3D printing would work best for the formal name plates. They struggled at first but their designs eventually became incredible here is the result:

I learned so much from PNP (Project Name Plate). Now here are the rundown details of how to use a laser cutter:
1) Choose the Right Material. Do not cut polycarbonate, it may look tempting to cut thin plastic but it wouldn't be fun to be gassed.
2)Design The Graphic. Design graphics on Adobe Illustrator and then import a file to your 3D printing laptop/computer.
3)Transfer the Design File. Turn the image into a .dxf file.
Setup the Laser Cutter. Remember to turn on the laser cutter and dump out any excess waste in the trash can from previous projects.
4)Preview the Cutting Trajectory. Drag the image onto the designated spot you want the laser cutter to cut your design.
5)Begin the Process. Adjust the speed(1-100) and type of cut(engraving or cut) you want the laser cutter to do.
6)Monitor it throughout. (make sure anything isn't catching on fire)
7)Unloading. Wait 10 seconds before opening the laser cutter to make sure the gas has ventilated and it isn't super hot before taking out your cut.
