PNP PROJECT OVERVIEW:
In project PNP, I worked with the lasercutter team and created some designs for name plates (requested by our admissions team at Webb)
I got to work with Adobe Illustrator to create and use designs of the Webb Logo.

I also leared how to use a laser cutter to cut out this design.
