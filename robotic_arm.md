So in this unit I learned a LOT. 
My original goal was to access vision and control of the robotic arm. (credits to Thomas) who made life easier by writing some codes and showing me how the code worked. 
The code he wrote was to make the robotics arm pick up Jenga blocks. It was fairly simple, we just adjusted the coordinates on the original
code so the robotic arm can pick up the blocks, spaced one post-it note apart when the table is turned a certain way. (
If the table was turned a little off or the post-its weren't stuck on at the right spot, the code wouldn't work.
Here is a picture/sample of our code:

So after playing with some silly block codes (written by seniors from last year) and crashing out about how basic the current code was, we decided to upgrade our plan. I had the 
idea of playing with the vision on the arm, I know a great app that detects objects, after you train the model to recognize the blocks/objects, and improves robotic arm accuracy.
Not long after I proposed the idea, we found that it might not work, so we just scrapped the plan and started to use aprilcodes. 
Here are pictures of these things:

We didn't completely finish making a code for the robotic arm to detect the aprilcodes, but I know I definitley learned a lot from the websites Thomas told me to look at.
Here's a break down of what I learned:
1) AprilTags are square markers that help computers detect object position, distance, and orientation in image
2) They’re easy to recognize under varying lighting or angles because they store minimal data.
3) Used in robotics and 3D vision, and can be detected in Python with OpenCV and the apriltag library.

So after what I've discovered I think I should also include a basic run down of a robotic arm!
1) usually a machine used in factories for precision and accuracy of placing and creating items
2) originated from the Renaissance period where DaVinci created the MechaKnight (improved in 1950s to 1960s industrial period)
3) Nowadays, it is highly similar in structure to that of a human arm and can perform similar tasks to that of a human arm.
4) Now students like me and Thomas can help you guys make the tool become more accesible (I will be telling you guys what controls what and how soon...)

Now, here is the best part:
To access the robotic arm you don't need much, when you walk into the innovation room you might see a black PC, that is what controls the robotic arm and where our secret stash of codes
are hidden. (We won't get mad if you use it). 
You will find the password on one of the manuals hidden in the dark depths of the room, I cannot tell you where sadly.
After you get access to the PC, open up chrome and you will find a couple of uFactory tabs open. 
One of them has a bunch of block codes, they are quite silly, but you can also create your
own codes in Visual Studio Code. 
WARNING: YOU DON'T EXACTLY NEED TO KNOW HOW TO WRITE PYTHON, SOMETIMES WEBBGPT CAN DO IT FOR YOU! (me and thomas found it highly useful)
The most important lesson you should learn is to be creative and muck around (like Dr. Dzula always says). Even if you didn't finish your project, you will learn a lot
It's not the product that matters, it's the process on how the product came to be that matters.

Thanks,
